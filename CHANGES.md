Upyo changelog
==============

Version 0.2.2
-------------

To be released.


Version 0.2.1
-------------

Released on August 4, 2025.

### @upyo/smtp

 -  Fixed “Maximum call stack size exceeded” error when sending large
    attachments.  [[#6]]

    The SMTP transport now uses `Buffer.from().toString('base64')` instead of
    the legacy `btoa()` function for base64 encoding, which resolves stack
    overflow issues with large attachments (e.g., 500KB+ files).

 -  Fixed UTF-8 encoding issue where email addresses were incorrectly encoded
    in SMTP headers.  [[#7]]

    Only display names are now encoded using RFC 2047 encoding, while email
    addresses remain unencoded. For example, `German ÄÖÜ <info@example.com>`
    now correctly becomes `=?UTF-8?B?...?= <info@example.com>` instead of
    encoding the entire string including the email address.
