Upyo changelog
==============

Version 0.2.5
-------------

To be released.


Version 0.2.4
-------------

Released on December 13, 2025.

### @upyo/core

 -  Fixed a potential SMTP command injection vulnerability.

    Email addresses are now validated to prevent newline characters (`\r` or
    `\n`), which could be used to inject malicious SMTP commands.


Version 0.2.3
-------------

Released on December 12, 2025.

### @upyo/ses

 -  Fixed headers serialization issue on edge runtimes.  [[#15]]

    The SES transport now converts the `Headers` object to a plain object
    before passing to `fetch()`, which resolves “Missing Authentication Token”
    errors on edge runtimes like Bunny CDN Edge that don't properly serialize
    `Headers` objects.

Version 0.2.2
-------------

Released on November 3, 2025.

### @upyo/smtp

 -  Added STARTTLS support for secure connection upgrade.  The SMTP transport
    now automatically detects and uses STARTTLS when connecting to servers
    that advertise this capability (such as Protonmail, Office 365, and others).
    This allows using port 587 with `secure: false` for automatic encryption
    upgrade.  [[#14]]


Version 0.2.1
-------------

Released on August 4, 2025.

### @upyo/smtp

 -  Fixed “Maximum call stack size exceeded” error when sending large
    attachments.  [[#6]]

    The SMTP transport now uses `Buffer.from().toString('base64')` instead of
    the legacy `btoa()` function for base64 encoding, which resolves stack
    overflow issues with large attachments (e.g., 500KB+ files).

 -  Fixed UTF-8 encoding issue where email addresses were incorrectly encoded
    in SMTP headers.  [[#7]]

    Only display names are now encoded using RFC 2047 encoding, while email
    addresses remain unencoded. For example, `German ÄÖÜ <info@example.com>`
    now correctly becomes `=?UTF-8?B?...?= <info@example.com>` instead of
    encoding the entire string including the email address.
